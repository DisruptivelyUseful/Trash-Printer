This folder contains all of the unique info for building the Trashprinter Mini, based on the V3 of the Trashprinter.  The Mini uses a smaller cart, which is also available from [Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/material-handling/hand-trucks-carts-dollies/service-carts/30-in-x-16-in-industrial-polypropylene-service-cart-58322.html).  All of the STL/SVG parts are the same as the original full-size V3. It's primarily the lead screws that will need to be cut to match the proportions of the smaller service cart frame.

We recently recorded video content showcasing the entire build process of the Mini version.  Edited video will be released in the future, but in the meantime, the raw video content can be seen on our twitch streams at [twitch.tv/DisruptivelyUseful](https://twitch.tv/disruptivelyuseful) and [twitch.tv/Drc3p0](https://twitch.tv/drc3p0)


* The extruder built during the livestream contained a 20mm x 35mm heater band.
